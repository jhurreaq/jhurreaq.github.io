I am a researcher interested in applied mathematics. In particular, I do research to better understand why and how complexity emerge in real-world systems through frameworks that integrate multi-scale aspects into consistent tractable mathematical models. To that end, I combine probability theory, stochastic simulation algorithms and deterministic approaches as ordinary or partial differential equations.

## About me

I am a control engineer, with a strong background in control theory and applied mathematics. I have considerable experience in modeling, simulation, and optimization-based control of dynamical nonlinear systems. Currently, I am about to successfully complete a Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering at Universidad de Antioquia Colombia. For four years, I was working on the development of multiscale models of nonlinear dynamical systems. I developed a three-scale dynamical model that describes the dynamics of the synthesis of core/shell type polymers in batch polymerization reactors and reduced order approximations. Such development was recently published in the journal of Computers and Chemical Engineering (Elsevier). This development led me to the study of PDE/ODEs – kMC type multiscale models which are powerful to describe a wide range of complex dynamical systems, e.g., human tissue-like materials.
To better understand the complexity of the solution of PDE/ODEs – kMC multiscale models, I was working, for 18 months, as a guest researcher, at the Institute of Continuous Mechanics (IKM), Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. I formulated a consistent solution of these models using the finite element method, multiple approaches widely studied in the area of fluid mechanics and solid mechanics (for instance, algorithms to solve elasto-plastic models and advection-diffusion problems), as well as, model order reduction techniques based on the proper orthogonal decomposition method and its application in uncertainty propagation analyses.
The latest development at IKM I was involved in was related to the blood glucose level regulation in type 1 diabetes patients. We analyzed the stability of the closed-loop strategies to regulate the blood glucose based on insulin pumps. A Gaussian process surrogate model based numerical strategy was proposed to estimate stabilizing sets of PID controller tackling uncertain nonlinear systems. The result of the random analysis is a stochastic set providing probability information regarding the capabilities of a PID controller to stabilize the non-linear system.
