## Research interests

My current resarch interests are placed on the mathematical modeling of complex uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems.

_"I am a control engineer, with a strong background in control theory and applied mathematics. I have considerable experience in modeling, simulation, and optimization-based control approaches. My current research interests are placed on robust control of nonlinear systems and modeling of complex dynamical systems from a multiscale perspective"_.
