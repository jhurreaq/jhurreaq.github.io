I am a researcher interested in applied mathematics. In particular, I do research to better understand why and how complexity emerge in real-world systems through frameworks that integrate multi-scale aspects into consistent tractable mathematical models. To that end, I combine probability theory, stochastic simulation algorithms and deterministic approaches as ordinary or partial differential equations.

## About me
I received my Bachelor in Control Engineer at Universidad Nacional de Colombia in 2013 and my Master’s degree in Engineering from Universidad de Antioquia in 2017. Currently, I am about to successfully complete my Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering at Universidad de Antioquia Colombia.

## Research roadmap

Since 2016 I had been working on the development of multiscale models of nonlinear dynamical systems. I developed a three-scale dynamical model that describes the dynamics of the synthesis of core/shell type polymers in batch polymerization reactors and reduced order approximations. This development led me to the study of PDE/ODEs – kMC type multiscale models which are powerful to describe a wide range of complex dynamical systems, e.g., human tissue-like materials and lithium-ion batteries. 

For almost 2 years I was a guest researcher at the Institute of Continuous Mechanics (IKM), Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. As foremost outcome I formulated a consistent solution of PDE/ODEs – kMC multiscale models using the finite element method, multiple approaches widely studied in the area of fluid mechanics and solid mechanics (for instance, algorithms to solve elasto-plastic models and advection-diffusion problems), as well as, model order reduction techniques based on the proper orthogonal decomposition method and its application in uncertainty propagation analyses.

In the long term, I envisage myself significantly contributing to the field of modeling complex multiscale systems. 

## Ongoing research

My current research focuses in assessing COVID-19 spreading and providing time-critical information for control and mitigation. Dynamic modeling approaches combining Bayesian inference and compartmental models are some of the analytical tools used to capture the intrinsic stochasticity and multiscale nature of the phenomenon, infer and derive implications to support rational policy-making.
