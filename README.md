I am a researcher interested in applied mathematics. In particular, I do research to better understand why and how complexity emerge in real-world systems through frameworks that integrate multi-scale aspects into consistent tractable mathematical models. To that end, I combine probability theory, stochastic simulation algorithms and deterministic approaches as ordinary or partial differential equations.

## About me

I received a Bachelor as Control Engineer from Universidad Nacional de Colombia in 2013 and a Master’s degree in Engineering from Universidad de Antioquia in 2017. Currently, I am about to successfully complete a Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering at Universidad de Antioquia Colombia. 


For four years, I was working on the development of multiscale models of nonlinear dynamical systems. I developed a three-scale dynamical model that describes the dynamics of the synthesis of core/shell type polymers in batch polymerization reactors and reduced order approximations. This development led me to the study of PDE/ODEs – kMC type multiscale models which are powerful to describe a wide range of complex dynamical systems, e.g., human tissue-like materials and lithium-ion batteries.


To better understand the complexity of the solution of PDE/ODEs – kMC multiscale models, I was working, for 18 months, as a guest researcher, at the Institute of Continuous Mechanics (IKM), Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. 


In the long term, I envisage myself significantly contributing to the field of modeling complex multiscale systems. What captures my interest the most is the possibility to work with dynamic modeling approaches able to capture the intrinsic stochasticity and multiscale nature of socio-political and economic problems such as the Covid-19 pandemic and its potential to support rational policy-making.
