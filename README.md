Why and how does complexity emerge in real-world systems? A huge part of the world exists outside scales reachable from humans' perception. Part of such dimensions exists at higher orders of magnitude (let’s say at the supra-scale) whereas another part exists at smaller orders of magnitude (the micro-scale). Therefore, the Universe where we live is perceived as multiscale. In fact, the boundaries between the scales in the real-world are blurry. There is always a fuzzy overlap between adjacent scales that usually leads to complex interactions among them. In principle, different scales are present whenever you lose sight of some phenomenon after you focus on another one. If you look through a microscope, you cannot see stars. If you look through a telescope, you cannot see microbes.

I am investigating the complexity of nonlinear dynamical systems. I want to better understand how randomness or unpredictability emerges naturally as a result of our inability to perceive all different scales or dimensions of real-world systems. Single-scale models are unable to capture all the relevant information of real nonlinear systems leading to some mistaching between predictions and reality reflecting the amount of relevant information is missing. Multiscale approximations, on the other hand, increase the available information about the system opening the possibility of a better understanding the source of the complexity. However, since many different scales in nature remain unobservable for us, it is important to know how that missing information influences observable phenomena. For that, I am exploring frameworks that integrate multiple scale into consistent tractable mathematical models. To that end, I combine probability theory, stochastic simulation algorithms, and deterministic approaches as ordinary or partial differential equations in a single multiscale framework to modeling the different scales ranging from the micro to the macroscopic one.

## About me
I received my Bachelor in Control Engineer at Universidad Nacional de Colombia in 2013 and my Master’s degree in Engineering from Universidad de Antioquia in 2017. Currently, I am about to successfully complete my Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering at Universidad de Antioquia Colombia.

## Research roadmap

Since 2016 I had been working on the development of multiscale models of nonlinear dynamical systems. I developed a three-scale dynamical model that describes the dynamics of the synthesis of core/shell type polymers in batch polymerization reactors and reduced order approximations. This development led me to the study of PDE/ODEs – kMC type multiscale models which are powerful to describe a wide range of complex dynamical systems, e.g., human tissue-like materials and lithium-ion batteries. 

For almost 2 years I was a guest researcher at the Institute of Continuous Mechanics (IKM), Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. As foremost outcome I formulated a consistent solution of PDE/ODEs – kMC multiscale models using the finite element method, multiple approaches widely studied in the area of fluid mechanics and solid mechanics (for instance, algorithms to solve elasto-plastic models and advection-diffusion problems), as well as, model order reduction techniques based on the proper orthogonal decomposition method and its application in uncertainty propagation analyses.

In the long term, I envisage myself significantly contributing to the field of modeling complex multiscale systems. 

## Ongoing research

I recently joined the group of Viola Priesemann at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in Göttingen.

My current research focuses in assessing COVID-19 spreading and providing time-critical information for control and mitigation. Dynamic modeling approaches combining Bayesian inference and compartmental models are some of the analytical tools used to capture the intrinsic stochasticity and multiscale nature of the phenomenon, infer and derive implications to support rational policy-making.
