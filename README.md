I am a researcher interested in applied mathematics. In particular, I do research to better understand why and how complexity emerge in real-world systems through frameworks that integrate multi-scale aspects into consistent tractable mathematical models. To that end, I combine probability theory, stochastic simulation algorithms and deterministic approaches as ordinary or partial differential equations.

## About me

I received a Bachelor as Control Engineer from Universidad Nacional de Colombia in 2013 and a Master’s degree in Engineering from Universidad de Antioquia in 2017. Currently, I am about to successfully complete a Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering at Universidad de Antioquia Colombia. 


For four years, I was working on the development of multiscale models of nonlinear dynamical systems. I developed a three-scale dynamical model that describes the dynamics of the synthesis of core/shell type polymers in batch polymerization reactors and reduced order approximations. This development led me to the study of PDE/ODEs – kMC type multiscale models which are powerful to describe a wide range of complex dynamical systems, e.g., human tissue-like materials and lithium-ion batteries.


To better understand the complexity of the solution of PDE/ODEs – kMC multiscale models, I was working, for 18 months, as a guest researcher, at the Institute of Continuous Mechanics (IKM), Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. 


## Research interests

My current research interests are placed on the mathematical modeling of complex uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems.
