I am a researcher interested in applied mathematics. In particular, I am interested in frameworks that integrate multi-scale aspects of real-world systems into consistent tractable mathematical models to better understand why and how complexity emerge. To that end, I combine probability theory, Monte Carlo or stochastic simulation algorithms with deterministic approaches as ordinary or partial differential equations for the computational implementation of the mathematical models.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Mathematics of Social Systems and Applications to Public Policy at the Mathematical Institute at Oxford University, in the Mathematical Data Science group.

You can find a list of my publications on Google Scholar and more information about me here.



## About me

I am a control engineer, with a strong background in control theory and applied mathematics. I have considerable experience in modeling, simulation, and optimization-based control approaches. My current research interests are placed on robust control of nonlinear systems and modeling of complex dynamical systems from a multiscale perspective.

## Research interests

My current research interests are placed on the mathematical modeling of complex uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems.
