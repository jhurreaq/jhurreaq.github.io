## About me
I received my Bachelor in Control Engineer at Universidad Nacional de Colombia in 2013, and my Master’s degree in Engineering from Universidad de Antioquia in 2017.

## Research roadmap

Since 2016 I had been working on the development of multiscale models of nonlinear dynamical systems. I developed a three-scale dynamical model that describes the dynamics of the synthesis of core/shell type polymers in batch polymerization reactors and reduced order approximations. This development led me to the study of PDE/ODEs – kMC type multiscale models which are powerful to describe a wide range of complex dynamical systems, e.g., human tissue-like materials and lithium-ion batteries. 

For almost 2 years I was a guest researcher at the Institute of Continuous Mechanics (IKM), Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. As foremost outcome I formulated a consistent solution of PDE/ODEs – kMC multiscale models using the finite element method, multiple approaches widely studied in the area of fluid mechanics and solid mechanics (for instance, algorithms to solve elasto-plastic models and advection-diffusion problems), as well as, model order reduction techniques based on the proper orthogonal decomposition method and its application in uncertainty propagation analyses.

In the long term, I envisage myself significantly contributing to the field of modeling complex multiscale systems. 

## My research interests

*Why and how does complexity emerge in real-world systems?* A huge part of the world exists outside scales reachable from humans' perception. Part of such dimensions exists at higher orders of magnitude (let’s say at the supra-scale) whereas another part exists at smaller orders of magnitude (the micro-scale). Therefore, the Universe where we live is perceived as multiscale. In fact, the boundaries between the scales in the real-world are blurry. There is always a fuzzy overlap between adjacent scales that usually leads to complex interactions among them. In principle, different scales are present whenever you lose sight of some phenomenon after you focus on another one. If you look through a microscope, you cannot see stars. If you look through a telescope, you cannot see microbes.

I am investigating the complexity of nonlinear dynamical systems. I want to better understand how randomness or unpredictability emerges naturally as a result of our inability to perceive all different scales or dimensions of real-world systems. Single-scale models are unable to capture all the relevant information of real nonlinear systems leading to some mistaching between predictions and reality reflecting the amount of relevant information is missing. Multiscale approximations, on the other hand, increase the available information about the system opening the possibility of a better understanding the source of the complexity. However, since many different scales in nature remain unobservable for us, it is important to know how that missing information influences observable phenomena. For that, I am exploring frameworks that integrate multiple scale into consistent tractable mathematical models. To that end, I combine probability theory, stochastic simulation algorithms, and deterministic approaches as ordinary or partial differential equations in a single multiscale framework to modeling the different scales ranging from the micro to the macroscopic one.

## Ongoing research

My current research focuses in the computational modeling of the chemical mechanisms leading to the crosslinking of Ca-alginate hydrogels. The process that mimics a bath‐assisted printing process where alginate is deposited into calcium ions bath and the crosslinking process take place due to the calcium ions diffusion into the gel matrix. In this printing technique, it is important to use an optimum concentration of ions for rapid gelation of the bioinks while material specifications are maintained. However, this rapid gelation may also cause poor stability of the final 3D printed structure. Therefore, the addition of ions to the polymer solution should be performed in a controllable manner. Combining the well-known Mikkelsen-Elgsaeter (ME) chemical model and the Finite Element Method will make possible to predict calcium ions concentration profile inside the hydrogel as a function of the chemical reactions, crosslinker diffusion within the gel matrix, and gelation time. Understanding these phenomena is of utmost importance for achieving desirable biomechanical stability of printed structures which is key to improve ca-alginate hydrogels behavior as functional materials to store living cells or active chemical compounds such as medicaments. Due to the direct connection between crosslinking methods and properties of 3D bioprinted structures, this research can provide new ideas for developing necessary modifications to the design and manufacturing process of advanced tissue‐like constructs in future.

*Significance of the research*
Many scientific reports related to the application of hydrogels as highly hydrated environment that mimics extracellular matrix, making them ideal to produce biomimetic and biologically inspired tissue constructs. Nevertheless, a low number of products are currently being used in clinical trials. This time lag reflects the need for optimized designs of smart hydrogels. With the execution of this project, we hope to shorten the gap in the time that takes the hydrogels research to be implemented in vivo applications. Model-based approaches have shown a big potential to deeply understand a lot of complex systems. Industry could take advantage of this feature to reduce their investment in experiments before obtaining a final product with specified characteristics. A speed up in the design process would be even more ground-breaking for innovative bioprinting settings or in combination with other technologies, such as organ-on-a-chip. In these contexts, advancements are urgently needed to obtain material properties closer to native tissues or to refine multi-material strategies for anisotropic structures, such as for the optimal design of capillary networks to augment nutrients delivery and waste removal in thick constructs or to tune construct material properties in space and time (4D bioprinting).
